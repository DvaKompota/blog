# The Ultimate Test Automation Tool for Web Apps

**Disclaimer:** Everything in this and the following articles is purely subjective and based on my personal experience. As always, your mileage may vary. Every heavily opinionated thought, bit of irony, or joke you encounter is here to make this content easy and enjoyable to read. But more importantly, it's an open invitation to discuss the topic. After all, I believe a good debate is the quickest (and most fun) way to the best all-around solutions for our professional community and the industry at large.

With that out of the way, let's start with the least controversial topic ever: which programming language is _obviously_ the best? Curly braces or indents? Tabs or spaces? To semicolon or not to semicolon?  
Don't worry, we are not here to start another holy war... this time üôÇ

But seriously, when it comes to test automation, picking the right language can make or break your efficiency. So let's dive into the languages that actually make sense for modern web automation.

## Language Support ‚Äî Built for Today's Web

Statistically, today's web is still heavily running on PHP, but we're not talking about testing WordPress sites here. There are some popular solutions in Python, like Flask and Django, typically used for lightweight, quick-to-build apps, with some notable exceptions. But in the big picture, commercial web development is dominated by JavaScript and TypeScript. And in the world of test automation for modern web applications, Playwright stands out by offering **native TypeScript support**, while also being versatile enough to support **Python, Java, and .NET**.

When compared to its competition, Playwright shines. **Cypress** also supports JS and TS, but it has very limited access to the **Node.js** space (which is only exposed through `cy.commands` ‚Äî a cumbersome and limited interface). On the other hand, **Selenium** is often implemented with **Java**, and while **Python** comes in as a second choice for Selenium users, neither language dominates modern web development like **JS/TS**.

If you choose to write your test automation in **TypeScript**, you unlock significant advantages:

- You gain **language expertise** from your frontend developers. Since they're already familiar with JS/TS, they can easily assist in writing or maintaining tests if needed.
- With full access to **browser APIs** (which Playwright provides), you can directly **execute JavaScript code** in the browser. This is a huge benefit, especially if your framework is already written in TypeScript, as it simplifies the process of interacting with the browser's runtime when needed.
- Once your framework's architecture is in place, along with a few good examples of **page objects** and **tests**, your developers can start writing end-to-end tests alongside their feature development. This eliminates two longstanding issues in test automation:
  - **Automation engineer scarcity**, which often creates bottlenecks or leaves new code inadequately tested;
  - **Test automation lagging behind development**, where tests are created separately and often come in weeks or even months after the features they're meant to validate.

By integrating test writing into the development workflow and utilizing the same language, you ensure that test automation progresses in sync with feature development, preventing delays and reducing the risk of critical features going untested.

| Language                | Selenium | Cypress | Playwright |
|-------------------------|:--------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| JavaScript / TypeScript |    ‚úÖ    |    ‚úÖ   |     ‚úÖ     |
| Python                  |    ‚úÖ    |    ‚ùå   |     ‚úÖ     |
| Java                    |    ‚úÖ    |    ‚ùå   |     ‚úÖ     |
| C# / .NET               |    ‚úÖ    |    ‚ùå   |     ‚úÖ     |

On a personal note, TypeScript wasn't always my go-to language. It still isn't. I originally automated in Python and couldn't stand TypeScript's curly-braced syntax or its synchronous nature. Advocating for it doesn't come naturally to me. But facts don't care about feelings, and the fact is, for React, Angular, or Next.js apps, TypeScript is the top choice when it comes to testing.

Now that we've settled the language debate, let's move on to browser support: What browsers should we test against? How should they be managed? And how can we ensure our apps run smoothly on all of them? Stay tuned for our next post on Browser Support.
